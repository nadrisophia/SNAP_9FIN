## SNAP !!

This is a simulation of a 2 player snap game.

The user gets to choose the number of decks to use in the game and start the simulation.

We are not taking into consideration the situation where both player say "SNAP" at the same time.

Each round we place a card in the middle. We decide who says "SNAP" on that round by choosing a random player.

#### Usage

To start the game run: ```python3 main.py``` and follow the instructions.
    
To run the test: ``` python3 -m unittest unit_test```
